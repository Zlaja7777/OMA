# OMA - Offer management application
To easily manage your projects.

OMA is a web application built on top of Angular powered by .NET Core. It is about creating an offer that can be transfered to a project. 
Later on you can add transactions and tasks for that project. By creating a task, you will have to add a worker that will be responsible
for it. 

The app is live here: http://wearedigiqal-001-site2.itempurl.com.
